Script to download the individual PDF pages from the former Lab Times journal and to assemble them into one PDF for each issue

The back issues of the journal Lab Times (published from 2007 to 2017) are still online (http://labtimes.org/labtimes/backissue/index.lasso). However, issues 4/2013 and older are not available as a single PDF download. This script downloads them all and assembles them into one single PDF file for each issue.
